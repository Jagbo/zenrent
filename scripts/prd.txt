# Making Tax Digital (MTD) Migration PRD

## Project Overview
ZenRent needs to migrate from the traditional Self Assessment API to HMRC's Making Tax Digital (MTD) APIs. MTD is HMRC's initiative to make tax administration more effective, efficient, and easier for taxpayers through a fully digital tax system. This migration is necessary to comply with HMRC's requirements and provide our landlord users with modern tax reporting capabilities.

## Business Objectives
1. Achieve compliance with HMRC's MTD requirements
2. Provide a seamless tax reporting experience for landlord users
3. Enable real-time tax data submission and status tracking
4. Reduce manual tax reporting burdens for landlords
5. Maintain data integrity and security throughout the tax reporting process
