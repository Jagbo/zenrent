# WhatsApp Configuration Environment Variables
# Copy these to your .env.local file and fill in with your actual values

# === REQUIRED VARIABLES ===

# WhatsApp Business Account ID
# This is ZenRent's central WABA ID (not individual landlord WABAs)
WHATSAPP_WABA_ID=your_waba_id_here

# Central Phone Number ID
# REQUIRED: The phone number ID for ZenRent's central WhatsApp number
# All tenant messages will be sent from this single phone number
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_central_phone_number_id_here

# System User Access Token
# Long-lived token from Meta Business Manager with WhatsApp permissions
# This token should have whatsapp_business_messaging and whatsapp_business_management permissions
WHATSAPP_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN=your_system_user_token_here

# Webhook Verification Token
# Random string you create and use in both your code and Meta App dashboard
# This verifies that webhook calls are coming from Facebook
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_secure_verify_token_here

# Facebook App Secret
# CRITICAL: Never commit this to version control
# Used for webhook signature verification (security)
FB_APP_SECRET=your_fb_app_secret_here

# Facebook App ID (public, can be exposed to client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_APP_ID=your_app_id_here

# === OPTIONAL VARIABLES ===

# WhatsApp API URL (defaults to production Facebook Graph API)
# Only set this if using a different API endpoint (testing/development)
WHATSAPP_API_URL=https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0

# Legacy token (may be deprecated - verify if still needed)
# WHATSAPP_TOKEN=

# Facebook Config ID for Embedded Signup (not used in centralized model)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_CONFIG_ID=

# === NOTES ===
# 1. The WHATSAPP_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN should be generated from a System User in Meta Business Manager
# 2. System Users provide long-lived tokens that don't expire like user tokens
# 3. Ensure your System User has admin access to ZenRent's WABA
# 4. The WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN should be a random, hard-to-guess string
# 5. Never use default values like "your_verify_token" in production

# === VERIFICATION ===
# Run the verification script to test your configuration:
# node scripts/verify-whatsapp-config.js

# To test sending a message (replace with a real WhatsApp number):
# node scripts/verify-whatsapp-config.js 447911123456 

# === PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT NOTES ===

# 1. Ensure WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID points to a verified phone number
# 2. Test message sending in development before production deployment
# 3. Monitor webhook delivery and message status updates
# 4. Set up proper logging for message delivery tracking

# === CENTRALIZED MODEL CHANGES ===

# These variables are NO LONGER USED in the centralized model:
# - Individual landlord WABA IDs (stored in whatsapp_accounts table)
# - Individual landlord phone numbers
# - Per-landlord access tokens

# All messages now route through:
# - Single WABA (WHATSAPP_WABA_ID)
# - Single phone number (WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID)  
# - Single access token (WHATSAPP_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN)
# - Landlord attribution via message prefixing
