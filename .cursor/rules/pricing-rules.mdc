## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does the 30-day free trial work?**
Your free trial begins immediately upon sign-up and includes access to core property management features. No payment information is required to start your trial. However, if you want to use WhatsApp integration, bank account connections, or HMRC tax filing, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan immediately.

**What happens when my free trial ends?**
At the end of your 30-day trial, you'll need to choose a paid plan to continue using ZenRent. Your data will be preserved, and you can seamlessly transition to any of our subscription plans.

**Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?**
Yes, you can change your plan at any time. If you upgrade, you'll be charged the prorated difference for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you downgrade, the new rate will apply at the start of your next billing cycle.

**How does the property count work?**
Each distinct property address counts as one property. For HMO properties (available on Standard and Professional plans), each property counts as one regardless of the number of units or rooms.

**When does billing begin?**
For paid plans, billing begins immediately upon subscription. Your selected plan will be activated as soon as your payment is processed. Free trial users are not charged until they upgrade to a paid plan.

**What payment methods are accepted?**
We accept all major credit cards, direct debit for annual subscriptions.

**Are there any hidden fees?**
No. Our pricing is transparent with no setup fees, cancellation fees, or hidden charges. What you see is what you pay.
