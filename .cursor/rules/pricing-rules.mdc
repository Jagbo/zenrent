## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?**
Yes, you can change your plan at any time. If you upgrade, you'll be charged the prorated difference for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you downgrade, the new rate will apply at the start of your next billing cycle.

**How does the property count work?**
Each distinct property address counts as one property. For HMO properties (available on Standard and Professional plans), each property counts as one regardless of the number of units or rooms.

**When does billing begin?**
Billing begins immediately upon subscription. Your selected plan will be activated as soon as your payment is processed.

**What payment methods are accepted?**
We accept all major credit cards, direct debit for annual subscriptions.

**Are there any hidden fees?**
No. Our pricing is transparent with no setup fees, cancellation fees, or hidden charges. What you see is what you pay.
